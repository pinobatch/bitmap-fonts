Bitmap Font Renderer
====================


1. Make a PNG file with glyphs in a monospace or proportional font
2. Write metadata about how glyphs are mapped to code points
3. Enter some text

...and it renders your text to a bitmap on screen, in a PNG file,
or sent straight to GIMP for pasting into a larger image.

I made it because modern font tools tend to neglect bitmap-first
fonts.  I find it useful for previewing whether dialogue in a VWF
fits in a particular box.
